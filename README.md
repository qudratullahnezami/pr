Handwritten Digit Recognition System
This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using TensorFlow and Keras. The system trains a neural network model on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset of handwritten digits, to classify digits from 0 to 9. Additionally, it supports digit prediction from external images.
